## üì¶ What Kind of Modpacks?

- Your modpack **must be a `.zip` file**.
- Inside the ZIP, include all mods you want installed (typically all `.jar` files for `/mods`).
- You can include additional folders (e.g., configs), but the installer extracts everything into your Minecraft `mods` folder, so it's worthless to include those in the zip.
